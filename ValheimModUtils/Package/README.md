# MilkWyzard's Valheim Mod Utils
**by MilkWyzard**

This mod does nothing on its own, but it provides general helper code and utilities for Valheim modding used in several of my [**MilkWyzard**] other Valheim mods.

## Installation (manual)
This mod depends on the Jotunn Valheim Mod Library (and its dependencies, BepInEx, MMHookGen). Follow the instructions on the [Thunderstone page for Jotunn](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn/) on how to manually install BepInEx, MMHookGen, and Jotunn.

After those mods have been installed, you may proceed with the installation of this mod. This mod comes packaged as a single DLL. Place the file *MilkWyzardStudios.ValheimModUtils.dll* in your BepInEx plugin folder. This folder is generally found in your Valheim install path at the following location:

*[ValheimInstallRoot]\BepInEx\plugins*.

## Changelog
#### Version 1.0.0

The initial release. Includes several helper functions for Unity as well as some texture utilities to build icons on the fly.
